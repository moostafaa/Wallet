# Digital Wallet Service

A robust, event-sourced digital wallet service built with .NET Core, implementing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and CQRS patterns.

## Architecture Overview

The service is built using a clean, layered architecture following DDD principles:

### Domain Layer
- Core business logic and rules
- Rich domain models with encapsulated behavior
- Domain events for state changes
- Value objects for immutable concepts
- Aggregates for transactional consistency

### Application Layer
- Orchestrates use cases
- Implements CQRS pattern with commands and queries
- Handles domain events
- Manages transactions and business workflows

### Infrastructure Layer
- Event sourcing implementation using EventStore
- Read model persistence using Entity Framework Core
- Repository implementations
- External service integrations

### API Layer
- RESTful API endpoints
- Command and query handling
- Input validation
- Error handling

## Key Features

### Wallet Management
- Create and manage digital wallets
- Support for multiple currencies
- Balance tracking and updates
- Transaction history

### Transaction Processing
- Funds transfers between wallets
- Top-up operations
- Withdrawals
- Payment processing
- Automatic transaction reconciliation

### Account Management
- Multi-wallet accounts
- KYC level management
- Account status tracking
- Transaction limits

### Risk Management
- Transaction monitoring
- Risk level assessment
- Account freezing capabilities
- Transaction limits enforcement

### Settlement & Reconciliation
- Batch settlement processing
- Merchant settlement management
- Transaction reconciliation
- Dispute handling

### Promotions & Rewards
- Cashback rules
- Referral bonuses
- Auto top-up rules
- Promotional campaigns

## Design Patterns

### Event Sourcing
- State reconstruction from events
- Complete audit trail
- Event store implementation
- Snapshot support for performance

### CQRS
- Separate command and query models
- Optimized read and write operations
- Event-driven updates
- Read model projections

### Domain-Driven Design
- Bounded contexts
- Rich domain models
- Aggregates
- Value objects
- Domain events

### Repository Pattern
- Aggregate persistence
- Read model queries
- Event store integration
- Snapshot management

## Technical Implementation

### Event Store
- Event persistence
- Stream management
- Snapshot storage
- Optimistic concurrency

### Read Models
- Denormalized views
- Query optimization
- Real-time updates
- Cached projections

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints
- Resource-based routing
- Proper HTTP method usage
- Comprehensive documentation

## Getting Started

1. Prerequisites:
   - .NET Core SDK
   - EventStore DB
   - SQL Server (for read models)

2. Configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "EventStore": {
       "ConnectionString": "esdb://localhost:2113?tls=false"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run the service:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   dotnet run --project src/WalletService.API/WalletService.API.csproj
   ```

## Testing

The service includes:
- Unit tests for domain logic
- Integration tests for repositories
- API tests for endpoints
- Event sourcing tests

## Performance Considerations

- Snapshot creation for large event streams
- Read model optimization
- Caching strategies
- Batch processing for settlements

## Security

- Transaction authorization
- KYC level enforcement
- Risk monitoring
- Account freezing capabilities

## Monitoring

- Transaction monitoring
- Balance tracking
- Risk assessment
- System health checks

## Error Handling

- Domain exceptions
- Business rule violations
- Concurrency conflicts
- Infrastructure failures

## Future Enhancements

- Additional currency support
- Enhanced fraud detection
- Mobile wallet integration
- Blockchain integration
- Real-time reporting
